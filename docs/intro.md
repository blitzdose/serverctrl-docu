## Getting started

The first thing you do is install the plugin. Currently only `Spigot` and `Paper` servers are officially supported.
You can download the plugin from various sources:
- [GitHub](https://github.com/blitzdose/ServerCtrl/releases/latest)
- [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/serverctrl.72231)
- [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/plugin/serverctrl)

To install the plugin, just place the `ServerCtrl_X.X.X.jar` into the `/plugins` folder of your server and restart it.

If you need a more detailed instruction go to the [Step by step guide](/docs/category/step-by-step-guide).
