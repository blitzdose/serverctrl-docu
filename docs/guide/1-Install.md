# 1 - Install

This chapter will help you get ServerCtrl up and running.

### Prerequisites

- A running `Spigot` or `Paper` Minecraft server
- A few minutes of your time

## Plugin

The first thing you do is install the plugin. Currently only `Spigot` and `Paper` servers are officially supported.
You can download the plugin from various sources:
- [GitHub](https://github.com/blitzdose/ServerCtrl/releases/latest)
- [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/serverctrl.72231)
- [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/plugin/serverctrl)

After you downloaded the `ServerCtrl_X.X.X.jar` from any of the above sources, just place it into the `/plugins` folder of your server and restart it.

## Credentials

On the first start, the plugin will generate an admin user and display username and password in the console. The user `admin` **has to exist**. If you delete this user, the plugin will create a new one.

## App

:::info
This step is **optional**. You don't have to use the app if you just use the web interface.
:::

If you want to use the cool ðŸ˜Ž Android, Windows or Linux app, download your version form one of the following sources:
- [GitHub](https://github.com/blitzdose/ServerCtrl/releases/latest) (Android, Windows, Linux)
- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.blitzdose.minecraftserverremote) (Android only)

If you don't want to use any of these or you have an unsupported device (e.g. Apple) you can also just use the built-in web interface. It comes with the plugin and doesn't require any additional setup.
